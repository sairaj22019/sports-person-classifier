#  Sports Person Classifier

This is a Machine Learning project that classifies images of famous sports personalities using computer vision and a classification model built with OpenCV and scikit-learn. The model is trained on a custom dataset and saved using `joblib` as `saved_model.pkl`.

##  Objective

To build a facial recognition-based image classifier that identifies and labels well-known sports personalities from a given image. This project combines facial detection (OpenCV) with machine learning classification (scikit-learn).
